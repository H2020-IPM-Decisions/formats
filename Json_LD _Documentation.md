# Json-LD Documentation

## What is JSON-LD (JSON-Linkdata)

Linked Data [LINKED-DATA] is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.

JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in JSON [RFC8259]. Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as Linked Data with minimal changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON, the large number of JSON parsers and libraries available today can be reused. In addition to all the features JSON provides.

JSON-LD introduces:
* a universal identifier mechanism for JSON objects via the use of IRIs,
* a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping them to IRIs via a context,
* a mechanism in which a value in a JSON object may refer to a resource on a different site on the Web,
* the ability to annotate strings with their language,
* a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,
and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social network, in a single document.

## JSON-LD Context for IPM-Decision

1. DSS_schema context: DSS_schema.jsonld
2. DSS_model context: DSS_model.jsonld

|Note: These contexts were difined using mainly schema.org context and some new Term difined below in term definition section.|
|-|

An example with VIPS using these contexts are available on [DSS_metadata/schema_VIPS_test_json](/DSS_metadata/schema_VIPS_test_json)  


## Terms definition

### Properties description can be issue from schema

| properties | Type | reference | description |
|--|--|--|--|
| address | Text | schema:streetAddress | The street address. For example, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy. |

**Questions?**
* Wouldn't it be better to identify people also with a unique ex identifier (ORCID number or organigram)? example (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9923-8817 for M.LABADIE or https://www.nibio.no/en/employees/berit-nordskog for berit NORDSKOG)
* For Pests and Crops EPPO code add url and identifier of the description of EPPO (https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PSILRO for pest, https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/DAUCS for crops)
* Is there a JSON for weather data that could be linked to the json LD or a table with identifier and description?

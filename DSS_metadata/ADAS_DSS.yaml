      This model assesses Cutworm risk in crops based on the work of Bowden et al., (1982). The model was originally devised to estimate an index of larval survival to third instar, based on temperature rate of development relationships and mortality due to daily rainfall.
      If no start date is inputted into the model the default will be used.The default is defined as the first day after 1st June where temperature exceeds 12 degrees.
      Any spray dates can be inputted into the model and are deemed to be 100% effective at removing cutworm from the model.
      The model will return the number of batches that survive to the third instar for the last three days of inputted weather data, the asscoiated risk and the recommended action.

      This is a simple Phase Indication DSS based on the work of Jacquemin et al., (2013). 
      It uses daily temperature (degrees celsius) and rainfall (mm) data to identify emergence in the Orange Wheat Blossom Midge. 
      Optional parameters can be inputted to set the thresholds at each of the phases of the Orange Wheat Blossom Midge Lifecycle. If not inputted, the defaults will be set.
      The model only runs between the months May and June and will therefore ignore any weather inputted before or after that time.
      The model will return, what Phase the insect is in. If the insect has emerged it will also provide the dates of the emergence. It will also provide a risk and the recommended action.

      This model is based on the work of Ferguson et al., (2015) to predict both migration and damage risk of the Pollen Beetle.
      Daily maximum air temperature is used to predict Migration Risk. The default value of 15 degrees celsius is used, as that is the temperature advised in the UK at which pollen beetles will fly. 
      Number of beetles per plant is used to predict Damage Risk. Control threshold levels of pollen beetle numbers are used as thresholds. These defaults are set to 2,5 and 15.
      Threshold however can also be overwritten by the user.
      The model can only be used between growth stage 51 and 59.
      The model returns the Migration Risk alongside the Damage Risk for the last three days of the inputted weather data.

      A simple DSS which predicts the dates of emergence for the Saddle Gall Midge based on a model derived by (Rowley et., 2017). Rainfall events followed by an accummulation of 512 degree days above 0 degrees C can be used to predict peaks.
      Cumulative emergence as a function of degree day accumulations was best described using a probit model.

      The model will start on the date of first rainfall on or after the 1st March and will end at the end of July.
      A Rainfall event is described as daily rainfall over the rainfall threshold (default 1mm) following 3 days without precipitation.
      Optional parameters can be inputted to set the thresholds. If not inputted, the defaults described above will be set.
      The model will return the dates of peak emergence, cummulative emergence, the associated risk and recommended action.

      This is an agnostic simple threshold comparison DSS. 
      It compares a provided observation value with a provided threshold value. 
      This DSS can therefore be used to represent a threshold-based DSS for any pest where there is a single threshold for action.
      An object is returned that contains two items:
              1) A risk rating (5 if threshold exceeded, 0 otherwise) and,
              2) an action message.

      This represents a threshold-based DSS where there are multiple thresholds for different types of action.
      The code compares a provided observation with a set of provided action thresholds, where different actions are required depending on which threshold is exceeded.
      An object consisting of the following is required:
         An observation (of type double)
         A list of risk classes where each risk class consists of:
                 1) A risk level (an integer number, ideally between 1 and 5 inclusive),
                 2) An action (text), and
                 3) A threshold (of type double) for the action.
      An object is returned that contains two items:
         1) A risk rating (5 if threshold exceeded, 0 otherwise) and,
         2) an action message.

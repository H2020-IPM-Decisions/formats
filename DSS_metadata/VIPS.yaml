    The warning system model «Carrot rust fly temperature» is based on a Finnish temperature-based model (Markkula et al, 1998; Tiilikkala & Ojanen, 1999; Markkula et al, 2000). The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st and 2nd generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5,0 °C. VIPS uses the model for the 1st generation only. 
    Standard air temperature (temperature measured 2 m above ground) is used in the model. Degree-days are defined for this model as the sum of the difference between a base temperature of 5,0 °C and the mean temperature for all days with a temperature >5,0 °C, in other words (daily mean temperature – 5,0 °C) from 1 March (beginning when the ground has thawed).

    The warning system model is based on weekly observations of adult carrot rust flies captured on yellow sticky traps. The model is based in its entirety on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. Traps are placed in the field edge and in the field and are examined for carrot rust flies weekly throughout the season. The number of adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first observation of 1 fly.

      Green rectangles indicate that the damage threshold has not been reached and there is no need for treatment.

      Yellow rectangles indicate that carrot rust flies have been caught on traps at the edge of the field and it may be necessary to treat. The field should be checked to evaluate whether treatment is necessary.

      Red rectangles indicate that carrot rust flies have been caught on traps in the field. The field should be checked to evaluate whether treatment is necessary.

      The damage threshold for the first observation on sticky traps is 1 fly. Attack will vary from field to field, we recommend therefore that observations are made in addition in the farmer’s own field. Control measures should be used as soon as possible after the first observation in the farmer’s own field (if the plants are dry, without precipitation and the plants have reached the first true-leaf stage. Consider, based on previous experience and the size and shape of the field whether the entire field or only the border rows should be treated.

    The model is based on several years of experiments where trap plants have been placed next to a potato field infected with late blight. Infections on these plants have been correlated with weather conditions the day of exposure, and this is the data the model is based on. The model predicts if there are favourable conditions for spore production and the following spread, survival and infection of these spores. The model produces an infection risk, and a value of 2.5 corresponds to one spot of late blight on each trap plant exposed. This value of 2.5 is the threshold where the model issues a warning.

    TOMCAST is based on a model that was originally developed for leaf spot diseases in tomato. The model that is used here is tested and adapted to be used against early blight in potato in Denmark (Alternaria solani). The model calculates daily risk values (DSV: Disease Severity Values) based on temperature and leaf wetness the previous day. DSV represents the risk of attack of early blight the previous 24 hours. Daily values of DSV are accumulated until a threshold value is reached, and treatment is recommended. When a spray is performed and entered into the model, accumulation of DSV is reset and starts over at 0.

    From a specific date (50% germination), daily risk values are accumulated based on weather data (temperature, relative humidity and precipitation). The risk is an accumulated value of how the weather affects late blight germination/infection, sporulation and growth. Alle processes are corrected for inhibition due to drying. After the accumulated risk has reached a certain limit (150), there will be an infection risk if there is one day with high infection risk. This model is together with time of row closure, used to decide the timing of first spray against potato late blight.

    This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness periods influence infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible host plants.
    
    Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of 12 consecutive hours of leaf wetness. The wet periods are calculated from sensors placed 30 cm above ground. If such a sensor is not available, data from leaf wetness sensors placed 2 m above ground are used.
    
    The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.
    
    It is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in parsley.

    # Definition of the result parameters specific for this DSS model
  output: 
    warning_status_interpretation: |-
      Downy mildew in lettuce normally occurs in the second half of the summer, and not every year in lettuce producing regions.
      Thus, spraying should only be considered after considering the likelihood of the disease being present.
      When the model indicates a high risk of infection, spraying should be considered given a) the likelihoold of the disease being present,
      given the time in the season, b) the lettuce variant's resilience towards the disease and c) the time since the last spraying.
      Normally you don't spray more often than every 10th day, but if the infection risk is considered high over a longer period and 
      actual field observations being made, one can consider a new treatment as early as 7 days since the last spraying.

    The warning system model «Carrot rust fly temperature» is based on a Finnish temperature-based model (Markkula et al, 1998; Tiilikkala & Ojanen, 1999; Markkula et al, 2000). The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st and 2nd generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5,0 °C. VIPS uses the model for the 1st generation only. 
    Standard air temperature (temperature measured 2 m above ground) is used in the model. Degree-days are defined for this model as the sum of the difference between a base temperature of 5,0 °C and the mean temperature for all days with a temperature >5,0 °C, in other words (daily mean temperature – 5,0 °C) from 1 March (beginning when the ground has thawed).

    The model determines the flight period. It gives information about the expected time of the first 
    oviposition and continued oviposition of the cabbage maggot in cruciferous crops. The model only 
    applies for cabbage maggot, not turnip fly.

    Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or double non-woven covers, etc.) with 
    early crops the preceding season (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight 
    period can start earlier due to higher soil temperature under the covers.

    This model should be used in combination with direct observations of eggs in the field. This is 
    due to large variability and to get an idea of the severity of attack.

    The model for the warning system for cabbage moth was developed by Dr. Nina Svae Johansen. 
    It is based on the minimum temperature threshold and the requirement for accumulated 
    day-degrees for the different stages of the cabbage moth [CITATION Joh96 \t \l 1044 ]. 
    The accumulated degree-day model calculates forecasts for development of the cabbage moth 
    through the summer, generates warnings for the time when eggs and small larvae can be 
    registered in the field and the best time for treatment [CITATION Joh97 \t \l 1044 ].

    Note that the model is based on temperature, it is not related to the presence or 
    absence of cabbage moth in the field. Thus, it is important to evaluate the situation in the field.

      Green rectangles indicate that there is no danger of attack. Green rectangles are shown prior to the start of oviposition (SUMDG < 158).
      Yellow rectangles (prior to red rectangles) indicate that oviposition has begun and that the farmer should make observations in the field. Yellow rectangles are first shown when the soil temperature has reached 158 day-degrees (SUMDG=158). Yellow rectangles are also shown later in the season, after a red warning, to indicate that it is beyond the optimal time for treatment (the small larval instars). The larvae are too big for effective chemical control (they seek shelter from the sun inside the heads).
      Red rectangles indicate the optimal time for treatment (when when registration in the field indicates attack). At this time most of the larvae are small and easily targeted on the outer leaves.
      Grey rectangles indicate that the warning has ended. The larvae are so big that chemical control is very difficult or no longer possible.

    The warning system model is based on weekly observations of adult carrot rust flies captured on yellow sticky traps. The model is based in its entirety on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. Traps are placed in the field edge and in the field and are examined for carrot rust flies weekly throughout the season. The number of adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first observation of 1 fly.

      Green rectangles indicate that the damage threshold has not been reached and there is no need for treatment.

      Yellow rectangles indicate that carrot rust flies have been caught on traps at the edge of the field and it may be necessary to treat. The field should be checked to evaluate whether treatment is necessary.

      Red rectangles indicate that carrot rust flies have been caught on traps in the field. The field should be checked to evaluate whether treatment is necessary.

      The damage threshold for the first observation on sticky traps is 1 fly. Attack will vary from field to field, we recommend therefore that observations are made in addition in the farmer’s own field. Control measures should be used as soon as possible after the first observation in the farmer’s own field (if the plants are dry, without precipitation and the plants have reached the first true-leaf stage. Consider, based on previous experience and the size and shape of the field whether the entire field or only the border rows should be treated.

    The warning system model is based on weekly observations of oviposition by the 
    brassica root flies [CITATION Bli991 \l 1044 ]. The model is based in its entirety 
    on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. The model does 
    not distinguish between the cabbage maggot and the turnip fly. The observations consist 
    of collecting sand from the base of 10 plants and floating the eggs in water. The 
    counts are registered in VIPS and the mean number of eggs is calculated. The observations 
    are compared to damage thresholds [CITATION Bli99 \l 1044 ] and warnings are calculated.
    The damage thresholds are related to the plants developmental stage and tell how many eggs 
    that can be on a plant before there will be a reduction in growth and yield. VIPS presents 
    two warning system models based on damage thresholds: one for newly planted cabbage and 
    one for cabbage that has been in the field more than 4 weeks. The model can also be set up 
    as a private warning for the farmer’s own field, in which case the model will vary between 
    the two different damage thresholds based on the age of the cabbage crop (starting at the 
    time of planting).
    The warning system model is only valid for cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. The damage 
    threshold for cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli the first 4 weeks after planting is 14 eggs 
    per plant per week. After 4 weeks the damage threshold changes to 40 eggs per plant per 
    week. Damage thresholds have not been determined for other crucifers.

      Green rectangles indicate that the damage threshold for cabbage based on the time from planting until the registration has not been reached and control measures are not needed.
      Red rectangles indicate that the damage threshold f for cabbage based on the time from planting until the registration has been reached and it may be necessary to use control measures. The field should be checked to evaluate whether treatment is necessary.
      This model does not use yellow rectangles. The warning goes directly from green to red when the damage threshold is exceeded.
      Blue rectangles indicate that there are missing observations. An observation is valid for 8 days. If there are more than 8 days before a new observation is registered in the system, the model will give a blue warning.
      The damage thresholds are related to the plants developmental stage and tell how many eggs that can be on a plant before there will be a reduction in growth and yield.
      The warning should tell the best time for treatment in relation to the damage thresholds. If the number of eggs registered exceeds the damage threshold, treatment against the maggots is recommended, if the plants are not protected by other means. Observe the ”days-to-harvest”. If the seeds (cauliflower or broccoli) were treated against maggots, treatment early in the season is not necessary.

    The model is based on several years of experiments where trap plants have been placed next to a potato field infected with late blight. Infections on these plants have been correlated with weather conditions the day of exposure, and this is the data the model is based on. The model predicts if there are favourable conditions for spore production and the following spread, survival and infection of these spores. The model produces an infection risk, and a value of 2.5 corresponds to one spot of late blight on each trap plant exposed. This value of 2.5 is the threshold where the model issues a warning.

    TOMCAST is based on a model that was originally developed for leaf spot diseases in tomato. The model that is used here is tested and adapted to be used against early blight in potato in Denmark (Alternaria solani). The model calculates daily risk values (DSV: Disease Severity Values) based on temperature and leaf wetness the previous day. DSV represents the risk of attack of early blight the previous 24 hours. Daily values of DSV are accumulated until a threshold value is reached, and treatment is recommended. When a spray is performed and entered into the model, accumulation of DSV is reset and starts over at 0.

    From a specific date (50% germination), daily risk values are accumulated based on weather data (temperature, relative humidity and precipitation). The risk is an accumulated value of how the weather affects late blight germination/infection, sporulation and growth. Alle processes are corrected for inhibition due to drying. After the accumulated risk has reached a certain limit (150), there will be an infection risk if there is one day with high infection risk. This model is together with time of row closure, used to decide the timing of first spray against potato late blight.

    This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness periods influence infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible host plants.
    
    Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of 12 consecutive hours of leaf wetness. The wet periods are calculated from sensors placed 30 cm above ground. If such a sensor is not available, data from leaf wetness sensors placed 2 m above ground are used.
    
    The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.
    
    It is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in parsley.

      Downy mildew in lettuce normally occurs in the second half of the summer, and not every year in lettuce producing regions.
      Thus, spraying should only be considered after considering the likelihood of the disease being present.
      When the model indicates a high risk of infection, spraying should be considered given a) the likelihoold of the disease being present,
      given the time in the season, b) the lettuce variant's resilience towards the disease and c) the time since the last spraying.
      Normally you don't spray more often than every 10th day, but if the infection risk is considered high over a longer period and 
      actual field observations being made, one can consider a new treatment as early as 7 days since the last spraying.

  Description: |
    The warning system model «Carrot rust fly temperature» is based on a Finnish temperature-based model (Markkula et al, 1998; Tiilikkala & Ojanen, 1999; Markkula et al, 2000). The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st and 2nd generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5,0 °C. VIPS uses the model for the 1st generation only. 
    Standard air temperature (temperature measured 2 m above ground) is used in the model. Degree-days are defined for this model as the sum of the difference between a base temperature of 5,0 °C and the mean temperature for all days with a temperature >5,0 °C, in other words (daily mean temperature – 5,0 °C) from 1 March (beginning when the ground has thawed).

  Description: |
    The model is based on several years of experiments where trap plants have been placed next to a potato field infected with late blight. Infections on these plants have been correlated with weather conditions the day of exposure, and this is the data the model is based on. The model predicts if there are favourable conditions for spore production and the following spread, survival and infection of these spores. The model produces an infection risk, and a value of 2.5 corresponds to one spot of late blight on each trap plant exposed. This value of 2.5 is the threshold where the model issues a warning.

  DSS_model_id: SEPAPIICOL
  Pests: 
  - SEPTAP # EPPO code
  Crops:
  - APUGD # EPPO code for celery
  Type_of_decision: Short-term tactical
  Type_of_output: Risk indication
  Description_URL: https://www.vips-landbruk.no/forecasts/models/SEPAPIICOL/
  Description: |
    This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness periods influence infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible host plants.
    
    Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of 12 consecutive hours of leaf wetness. The wet periods are calculated from sensors placed 30 cm above ground. If such a sensor is not available, data from leaf wetness sensors placed 2 m above ground are used.
    
    The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.
    
    It is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in parsley.
